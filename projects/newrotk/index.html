    <div class="subTitle">
        <h2>This game is still in very early development! Expect changes in gameplay/art/music/and more!</h2><br>
        This game is still very simple! <strong>As of now, the main gameplay loop is as follows:</strong><br>
        You are placed inside a shop, there are stands in which you can retrive items from. The stands have a limited stock and take time to replenish.<br>
        You take items that the Karens or shoppers request. If you fail to give the Karens the correct item in time, you loose a set rating ammount. If you give them the correct item in time you will gain rating.<br>
