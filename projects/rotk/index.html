    <div class="subTitle">
        This game is simple.<br>
        You have to give the Karens what they request.<br>
        There are 3 maps. A shop, garden, and a second shop.<br>
        The game has Gamejolt trophies and leaderboards. You'll need a Gamejolt account and token to use them.<br>
        This game was <strong>cancelled and will no longer be recieving updates.</strong><br>
        It was cancelled because it was getting hard to create new maps and add more content.<br>
        Also because the player didn't have an instructions on how to play.<br>
        And lastly, the controls are terrible.
